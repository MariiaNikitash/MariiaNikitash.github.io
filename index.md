### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was a favorite because it is the first lab, where we were working with command-line arguments. The 'sandwich' program followed a pattern to read the components of a sandwich from command-line arguments, and write       out a sentence describing an order for that sandwich as output. A program like this could be a part of a cash register software or ordering app, so it was very interesting for me to work on in with my partner.
