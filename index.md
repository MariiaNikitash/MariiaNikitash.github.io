### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was one of my favorites because, where we were working with command-line arguments. The `sandwich` program followed a pattern to read the components of a sandwich from command-line arguments and wrote out a sentence describing an order for that sandwich as output. A program like this is very similar to cash register software or ordering app, so it was very interesting for me to work on it.


* Lab 10
  
  Lab 10, part 2 is another one of my favorite labs because I had to organize California's population data by county, then I implemented the function `CountyIndex()` to find the location of the county I gave as an argument in the command line. A new and interesting part of this part was, organizing the information into one two-dimensional or 2D `std::vector` such that the data is organized like a table. I also learned new counties in California, which I had never heard of before.


* Lab 12

    This lab was my favorite because it provided hands-on experience in creating a visually appealing animation using C++ and GraphicsMagick. I enjoyed learning how to manipulate color channels, apply mathematical functions like `sin()` for smooth transitions, and combine them to generate a dynamic gradient. The step-by-step instructions and clear explanations made the process enjoyable and educational, enhancing my understanding of image processing in programming.
